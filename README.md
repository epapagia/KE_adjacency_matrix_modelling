# Keyword Extraction

This is a repository providing code and datasets used in "Keyword Extraction Using Unsupervised Learning on the Document's Adjacency Matrix".

Updates will be released soon. Stay tuned.

## Quickstart

The classic stopwords list of the English language, as well as the lists of common adjectives, reporting verbs, determiners and functional words, are available in the corresponding .txt files:
stopwords_snowball_expanded.txt, common_adjectives.txt, reporting_verbs.txt, determiners.txt, functional_words.txt

The main code of our approach utilizes the [PKE](https://github.com/boudinfl/pke) package (i.e., Gow_vs_Adjancency_matrix_modelling.ipynb).

### Download datasets

```git clone https://github.com/boudinfl/ake-datasets.git```

Then, you should assign to the variable *dataset_path* the target dataset's path (in Gow_vs_Adjancency_matrix_modelling.ipynb).
